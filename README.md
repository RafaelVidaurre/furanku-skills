# furanku-skills

A public collection of [agent skills](https://agentskills.io) — portable instruction packs for coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and friends. Skills live under `skills/` and follow the Agent Skills spec, so they install anywhere with:

```bash
npx skills add rafaelvidaurre/furanku-skills          # everything
npx skills add rafaelvidaurre/furanku-skills --skill council   # one skill
```

## Skills

### testing-best-practices

Guides agents to design, write, review, and maintain high-quality automated tests without imposing a testing methodology. It treats each test as evidence, choosing scope and fidelity from the risk while emphasizing observable behavior, determinism, diagnostics, refactor resilience, and suite health across unit and integration tests.

```
> Add tests for this change using the project's conventions.
> Review this test suite for brittle, flaky, or low-value tests.
> What is the smallest credible test for this database integration?
```

Explore the full guidance in the [interactive testing guide](artifacts/testing-best-practices.html), or open the [skill entrypoint](skills/testing-best-practices/SKILL.md).

### council

Convenes a council of AI models that debate a decision and vote their way to consensus — or run a multi-model brainstorm. Your agent acts as moderator: it spawns the seats (other model CLIs installed on your machine), runs blind first positions, an adversarial challenge round, and a convergence round, then delivers a verdict with the vote, the rationale, and the dissent.

```
> Convene the council: should we migrate this service from REST to gRPC?
> Council of 5, all fable-5, mixed efforts: brainstorm names for this product.
```

First run walks you through picking a bench from the CLIs it detects (claude, codex, grok, gemini, ...). Defaults persist per machine (`~/.config/council/config.json`) and per project (`.council.json`); anything you say in the prompt — seat count, models, efforts — overrides them for that run.
